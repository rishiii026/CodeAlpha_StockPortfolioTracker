# 📈 Stock Portfolio Tracker

A sleek, real-time stock portfolio tracker built using **Python**, **customtkinter**, and **yfinance**.  
This project was developed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**.

The application allows users to manage stock investments, track live prices, and visualize portfolio distribution with an interactive pie chart — all through a modern desktop interface.
